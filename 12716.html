<p class="indented"> 
    My last day at Stanford. Waves of a bittersweet flavor invade my head, crashing against the sandy shores of my cingulate gyrus, where the pangs of sadness attempt to demolish my happiness, whilst my prefrontal cortex is calling its backup guard to defend my sense of reason and happiness. I'm disappointed to leave this beautiful place, where sunny skies bloom in January, whereas the precious sun has completely wilted in Boston, and the memories of the magnificently fun times constantly tug at my heartstrings; however, I'm overwhelmingly excited at the thoughts of this upcoming semester at MIT! I'm moving out of Maseeh and into a lovely single on floorpi (3W) on East Campus, where 90% of my friends at MIT reside. Not only am I so excited to be living in such close proximity to my friends, but I'm also so absolutely excited to make a ton of new friends! East Campus is full of the most fun, most outgoing, most welcoming, most caring, most confident, most self-loving people I know, and I'm so super excited to be feeding off of everyone's energy and to share some of my own. </p>

    I'm particularly excited to enjoin in this supportive community, because my inner spirit of self worth and self confidence is ready to go exponential! My first semester, I was battling an extremely absorbing and draining depression; this January, looking at the scars of my sadness--my uncontrollable sobs, my irrational thoughts, and my seemingly bipolar mood, remembering how I oscillated between extremely ecstatic and abysmally woeful--caused me infinitely more pain. I found myself crying day in and day out. Two days ago, however, I cut open my chest, pulled out my heart, and figured out exactly what was going wrong inside me. I realized I was latching my self worth onto the way others treated me, and I realized that this mindset was extremely depraving--it was slashing my self worth day by day. Since I figured out what I was doing and what I have to fix, I'm truly excited for the future, and I can sense my happiness because I have been more productive and able to muster up more motivation in the past few days than I have any day during my first semester. The magnificent thing about my recent revelation, however, is that I know I am my own person, and I am definitely worth more than the sum of other people's views of me. </p>
