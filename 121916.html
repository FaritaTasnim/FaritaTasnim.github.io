<h2> Whirlwinds </h2>
<p class="indented"> 
   Whew. The sound of the breath of relief that never escaped my lips. As I danced, laughed, cried, sang, studied, and slept (though not much) through this semester, I couldn't help but feel as if the days slipped through my fingers like sand. Quicksand. During the spring of 2016, I experienced probably the absolute maxima and minima of my emotions thus far (assuming my emotions can be described by some random multivariate function), but I felt as if I never really took the chance to breathe and to reflect. Perhaps this is because life first semester, which was yuckily sorrowful, left me with a plethora of time to think, and I thought so hard I drilled myself into a spiraling depression. I realized that the dorm I was living in was sucking the joy out of me. Though I was certainly scared out of my mind at times, I sipped cooly on life my second semester. Take my hand. Let me take you on a journey. The ending is happy, I promise. </p>

   Since this post is going to be long, let me explain it with the use of a double-humped camel, or that boa constrictor eating an elephant from Le Petit Prince. I start off on an emotional low, then swing upwards into super-charged ecstasy, experience a dip in sales, swing back up after resolving my issues, and I am currently in the unknown. See the diagram below. </p>

<h3> Beginning Low </h3>
<p class = "indented">
   Let's run back to January. During this time, MIT's Independent Activities Period (IAP) was ongoing, and I was interning at Intel, helping the New Devices Group with their efforts in wearable technology and energy harvesting. I was living with my now ex-boyfriend. It's very easy to say that January was probably the rockiest time of my whole year. I was struggling not only with the feeling that I had not properly utilized my first semester at MIT, but also with the stress of dealing with a relationship that I could see crumbling before my eyes. I had really thought I loved this person, with whom I was determined to live through four years of long distance, but I found that dealing with the fact that playing video games was more important than spending time with me, among other lifestyle differences, waxed quite difficult. At the end of my senior year of high school, I gave a speech to my graduating class in which I emphasized that, no matter what we do, we should place first and foremost the people in our lives, because no matter how much we would like to believe that our successes and our endeavors are a result of only ourselves, it is our parents, our friends, our mentors, our teachers, and our loved ones who made it all possible. We are social human beings. I think it's a tragedy when people consistently value their work or their leisure above the people who care for them, so to play the role of a victim to this very tragedy was a dark paradox. I probably cried enough from September to January to fill the well Buffalo Bill trapped his victims in. That was dark. So were those couple months. </p>
    
<h3> The First Hump </h3>
<p class = "indented">
   So when I left California in January, I did so extremely joyously. I bounced on the balls of my feet all the way back to Boston. I was ready to leave, and I was extremely excited to start my second semester at MIT. I was moving into a new dorm: East Campus, where I had dreamed of living since Campus Preview Weekend in April of 2015. Unfortunately, I opted for Maseeh my first semester out of fear of my parents' judging eyes, but after experiencing the lack of openness and community there, I knew I had to leave. Maseeh just wasn't for me. East Campus was. To me, it was like the entrance to heaven. I loved the people there. I loved the community. I loved the sense of openness and friendship surrounding me. To demonstrate, one of my friends from East Campus, Jessy, helped me move out of Maseeh; she spent all day (literally around 7 hours) helping me pack all my stuff and roll it cross-campus to EC, and she helped me through all of this even though it took two trips. Another person who I had just met, Wei, generously allowed me to leave my stuff in her room while she and I were away for IAP, because my room was still housed by its previous resident during IAP. Another person who I met at the beginning of first semester, Carina, helped move all my stuff up one floor to my actual room and went grocery shopping with me. Carina and Jessy also let me crash in their room for a couple of days until I was able to move into my own room. </p>
