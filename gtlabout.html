<h2> About Us </h2>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   Hello there from Team Ashdod! This year, MIT is sending 6 undergraduate students to teach in 4 high schools in the port city of Ashdod, Israel. A 45-minute train ride to the south of Tel Aviv, Ashdod harbors some of Israel’s most beautiful beaches, as well as Givat Yonah, or Jonah’s Hill – the tomb of the prophet Jonah, who was swallowed by a whale. We are super excited to be teaching in Ashdod for the month! So who we are? And who are we teaching? Here’s a little intro to us.
</p>
    
<h3> Tiffany Yeh </h3>

<div class="video"><img src = "/images/tiffany.png" style="width:500px;"></img></div>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   Tiffany Yeh is a senior majoring in materials science and engineering with a minor in applied international studies. She plans a future career as a physician focusing on global health and health technology policy issues.  At MIT, Tiffany has pursued global health experiences that have taken her around the world – for example, she has worked with the World Health Organization in Geneva and the non-profit EnAble India in Bangalore, and has taught entrepreneurship for Global Startup Labs in Sri Lanka. For the past three years, Tiffany has been an undergraduate research assistant in Professor Sangeeta Bhatia’s Laboratory for Multiscale Regenerative Technologies where she has helped to investigate the potential of magnetic microrobots and magnetotactic bacteria to improve drug penetration to tumors. Tiffany is an Emerson Piano Scholar at MIT and hails from Taichung, Taiwan.</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   In Israel, Tiffany is teaching at Mekif Gimel, a comprehensive public school located in the city center that educates students coming from all backgrounds and parts of Ashdod. In addition to its regular classes, Gimel also has gifted programs (one of only a handful offered in the entire country), excellence programs, and special education programs. Tiffany is holding workshops in entrepreneurship, economics, and various discussion seminars for students in the gifted and excellence classes of grades 10-12. </p>
    
<h3> Zach Hulcher </h3>

<div class="video"><img src = "/images/zach1.png" style="width:500px;"></img></div>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   Zachary Hulcher, from Montgomery, Alabama, is pursuing a dual major in electrical engineering and computer science and physics, with a minor in mathematics. Hulcher is motivated by a desire to teach others. He has been a teaching assistant for the physics department at MIT, a grader in the mathematics department, and a tutor for MIT’s chapter of Eta Kappa Nu, the national honor society for electrical engineering and computer science. Zach has conducted physics research at CERN and Professor Rajagopal’s lab at MIT. Through MISTI's Global Teaching Labs, he traveled to Xalapa, Mexico, to assist with courses focused on mobile and internet technologies, and he taught courses on physics to high school students in Italy. Since his freshman year, Hulcher has been an offensive lineman with MIT’s varsity football team.

<p class="indented"> 
   For GTL Israel, Zach is teaching physics at Makif Alef, which he describes as such:
“Makif Alef is a public school in the city of Ashdod. Many of the students in the school are technology oriented, and so they are learning physics, electronics, robotics, etc. Some of the students are in a program which feeds them into technical careers with the Israeli air force as mechanics and engineers. The school is the first one in Ashdod, and thus it suffers from some of the typical problems its old construction and the lower socioeconomic backgrounds of some of the students. The teachers I have met are very passionate and proud to be helping these students from this flagship Ashdod school. The students I have met are very curious as well and have loads of about all the physics I’ve presented.” </p>
    
<h3> Hannah Diehl </h3>

<div class="video"><img src = "/images/hannah.png" style="width:500px;"></img></div>
    
<p class="indented"> 
  Hannah Diehl is a junior majoring in Physics and Computer Science. She grew up in the metro-Detroit area. She enjoys rock climbing, hiking, snowboarding, skiing, and comedy. Prior to coming to MIT, she had never been outside of North America, but she got her first real travel experiences doing Global Teaching Labs in Italy last year. She looks forward to exploring the culture of Israel through another great GTL experience.
</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   Hannah is teaching physics at Mekif Yud, a public school in southern Ashdod for high school-aged students. The school attracts more traditionally religious students from across the city. Each morning, students pray for an hour, and then attend classes for their academic subjects for the rest of the day.

<h3> ORT Yami </h3>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   At ORT Yami, Alex and Amalia teach ocean-based biology and chemistry and Farita teaches electrical engineering for marine applications. ORT Yami is a pre-Nay military boarding school for high school students in Ashdod. ORT Yami has a lively student population that enjoys the campus’ basketball courts and student-run garden. The curriculum focuses on the ocean and includes sailing, mathematics, marine biology, and chemistry, and prepares the students for service in the Israel Defense Forces.
 </p> 
    
<h3> Alex Denmark </h3>

<div class="video"><img src = "/images/alex.png" style="width:500px;"></img></div>
    
<p class="indented"> 
  Alexander Denmark is a sophomore studying Materials Science and Engineering and minoring in Environmental Engineering Science. He is from Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and enjoys shell-fishing, bike riding, hiking, and spending time on the ocean in his free time. Academically, Alexander has conducted research at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, UROP-ed in MIT’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, and enjoys studying the environmental impact of materials. He will be teaching Biology and Ocean Sciences at ORT Yami in Ashdod, Israel, and looks forward to visiting many religious sites in Israel, immersing himself in the Israeli culture, eating a lot of food, and teaching, but also learning from, his students.
</p>
    
<h3> Amalia Lee </h3>

<div class="video"><img src = "/images/amalia.png" style="width:500px;"></img></div>
    
<p class="indented"> 
  Amalia Lee is a sophomore studying Material Science and Engineering with a minor in music. She grew up in Honolulu, Hawaii, but has also lived in Bahrain, Georgia (the state), and Singapore before attending MIT. In her free time, she enjoys singing, doodling, and liking pictures of cute cats on Instagram. She is so excited to be in Israel and to explore such a beautiful and diverse country!
</p>
    
<h3> Farita Tasnim </h3>

<div class="video"><img src = "/images/farita.png" style="width:500px;"></img></div>
    
<p class="indented"> 
  Farita is a sophomore studying Electrical Engineering at MIT. She is from Dhaka, Bangladesh, but she grew up from the age of four in the good ol’ South. Farita’s main interests and research areas are designing and making circuits, building robots, making and optimizing alternative energy harvesting devices, and making novel clothes, technology-integrated fashion, and wearables. More than anything, she loves learning, and, in turn, teaching what she has learned. 
</p>
    
<p class="indented">
   Since she has received hundreds of hours of valuable mentorship from her robotics coach, engineering mentor and parents towards her pursuit of STEM, she has truly understood the importance of having one-to-one mentorship and inspiration from role models, and she wants to give back to the community that helped her go after her passions. Farita's love for STEM has allowed her to inspire many little scientists to pursue science, engineering and the arts in exciting ways. Passing down the baton and inspiring others is what gives her purpose, and that is exactly what she is doing in Ashdod, Israel, helping high school students build their own ocean wave energy harvesting device while teaching them about electrical engineering! One of her biggest future goals is to found, run, and teach in a global non-profit organization that connects scientists with youth in rural communities and slums, such as those widespread in Bangladesh, so that underprivileged children will be inspired and guided through their own project-based scientific journeys.
