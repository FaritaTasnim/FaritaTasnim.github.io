    <h2> 10.25.15 </h2>
    <p class="indented"> People cannot be quantified. Each individual person is a sum of their experiences, their actions, and their morals. Numbers are important in the sense that they provide some standard of measure of comparative comfort with certain tasks, realms of knowledge, etc; however, people are truly defined by their actions and their adventures. What someone wakes up and actively accomplishes and experiences is immensely more important than what score they make on an exam, how many hours they spent on their homework, and other such trivial things. Sure, school is a necessity because our society has deemed achieving a degree as a standard of measure of attaining a certain skill level in a given field of interest, and sure, we can’t quite blame society for adopting this standard of measure, for it saves time in determining better candidates for job roles, and for general credibility,  when you have a degree from a top university. This is a constant, but consider the case that many top university students are applying to highly sought after job positions, scholarships, awards, honors, whatever it is, and suddenly you’re just one fish in a big pond. </p>

<p class = "indented">How much more impressive would it be if you could talk to people about the amazingly interesting and crazy experiences you’ve had in your life because you simply love to enjoy life? Suddenly an interview in which you’re asked to discuss your interests transforms from a boring conversation about a project you completed in a class in perhaps an honorably unique way, or an award you won due to academic merit, into a much more engrossing conversation about a backpacking trip you took in Japan in which you rode around with a professor you met a karaoke bar and ended up collaborating with him on a project to transform how artificial intelligence takes place at the IC level, or about a trip you took to California on whim, meeting random people at Golden Gate park, and spending the rest of the evening creating jams from an audio mixer you create on the spot, because you’re the type of person who carries all the components needed to create an audio mixer in your backpack. How wonderful, how cool. Meeting people is such an important quality. Talking to people, really getting to know them, being interested in them, and sharing cool life experiences, having conversations about philosophy and random cool stuff, and then following up with hangouts, and creating shared experiences will lead to so many cool adventures. This is the way to live. Live fully. Embrace people. Make mistakes. Do crazy things you wouldn’t imagine doing before, within your moral limits, though, and live life fully. </p>
 <p class = "indented">
	This is my advice to myself. From now on, I do what I want. I create the experiences I want in life. I am happy, and that is a conscious choice I’m making.</p>
