<h2> 01.14.16 </h2>
<p class="indented"> The bottom line is I miss math. A couple minutes ago I had this crazily wondrous flashback, like the kind of flashback where I remember a time when I was the happiest and most motivated that I've ever been, as if I was Hercules an a journey to complete the 12 labors, but really I'm just me, and that heroic quest is a set of difficult, mind-racking math problems from past AIME's. I want to feel passion like I felt it then, and I want to feel it all the time, or at least some of the time? Please? I guess I am trying to figure out what I've been missing, you know. It's sort of like I'm Holden Caulfield in his confused journey to "adulthood," or at least an understanding of yourself so great you are completely happy with your life. I have felt like that before when I was discovering my passion for electrical engineering, except I'm doing it all over again now that I've started college, and I guess it just feels oddly disorienting, since I've been pretty oriented with myself for the past several years. </p>

<p class = "indented">I feel so jaded, and I'm confused as to why I allow the waves of sloth to roll in and burn out the embers of my now-ephemeral passions. It seems as though nowadays, all I'm looking for is a way out. A way to end my worries and simply "be free," though I've come to realize that such "freedom" comes at the price of true zeal and feelings. I want to be full again, even if that means being a geek happily solving math problems.</p>

	The advice I wrote to myself in October was good inspiration, but now it's time to actually follow my passions and accomplish things that are meaningful to me. The element of discovery and creation are most prominent on my list of things that make me happy. I'll go with that. I'll start slow and attempt to tackle my demons one at a time whilst trekking the path to living life not freely, but fully.</p>

<h2> 10.25.15 </h2>
<p class="indented"> People cannot be quantified. Each individual person is a sum of their experiences, their actions, and their morals. Numbers are important in the sense that they provide some standard of measure of comparative comfort with certain tasks, realms of knowledge, etc; however, people are truly defined by their actions and their adventures. What someone wakes up and actively accomplishes and experiences is immensely more important than what score they make on an exam, how many hours they spent on their homework, and other such trivial things. Sure, school is a necessity because our society has deemed achieving a degree as a standard of measure of attaining a certain skill level in a given field of interest, and sure, we can’t quite blame society for adopting this standard of measure, for it saves time in determining better candidates for job roles, and for general credibility,  when you have a degree from a top university. This is a constant, but consider the case that many top university students are applying to highly sought after job positions, scholarships, awards, honors, whatever it is, and suddenly you’re just one fish in a big pond. </p>

<p class = "indented">How much more impressive would it be if you could talk to people about the amazingly interesting and crazy experiences you’ve had in your life because you simply love to enjoy life? Suddenly an interview in which you’re asked to discuss your interests transforms from a boring conversation about a project you completed in a class in perhaps an honorably unique way, or an award you won due to academic merit, into a much more engrossing conversation about a backpacking trip you took in Japan in which you rode around with a professor you met a karaoke bar and ended up collaborating with him on a project to transform how artificial intelligence takes place at the IC level, or about a trip you took to California on whim, meeting random people at Golden Gate park, and spending the rest of the evening creating jams from an audio mixer you create on the spot, because you’re the type of person who carries all the components needed to create an audio mixer in your backpack. How wonderful, how cool. Meeting people is such an important quality. Talking to people, really getting to know them, being interested in them, and sharing cool life experiences, having conversations about philosophy and random cool stuff, and then following up with hangouts, and creating shared experiences will lead to so many cool adventures. This is the way to live. Live fully. Embrace people. Make mistakes. Do crazy things you wouldn’t imagine doing before, within your moral limits, though, and live life fully. </p>
 <p class = "indented">
	This is my advice to myself. From now on, I do what I want. I create the experiences I want in life. I am happy, and that is a conscious choice I’m making.</p>
