<h2> 1 Year Down, 3 To Go </h2>
<p class="indented"> 
   Whew. The sound of the breath of relief that never escaped my lips. As I danced, laughed, cried, sang, studied, and slept (though not much) through this semester, I couldn't help but feel as if the days slipped through my fingers like sand. Quicksand. During the spring of 2016, I experienced probably the absolute maxima and minima of my emotions thus far (assuming my emotions can be described by some random multivariate function), but I felt as if I never really took the chance to breathe and to reflect. Perhaps this is because life first semester, which was yuckily sorrowful, left me with a plethora of time to think, and I thought so hard I drilled myself into a spiraling depression. I realized that the dorm I was living in was sucking the joy out of me. Though I was certainly scared out of my mind at times, I sipped cooly on life my second semester. Take my hand. Let me take you on a journey. The ending is happy, I promise. </p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   Since this post is going to be long, let me explain it with the use of a double-humped camel, or that boa constrictor eating an elephant from Le Petit Prince. I start off on an emotional low, then swing upwards into super-charged ecstasy, experience a dip in sales, swing back up after resolving my issues, and I am currently in the unknown. See the diagram below. </p>

<h3> Beginning Low </h3>
<p class = "indented">
   Let's run back to January. During this time, MIT's Independent Activities Period (IAP) was ongoing, and I was interning at Intel, helping the New Devices Group with their efforts in wearable technology and energy harvesting. I was living with my now ex-boyfriend. It's very easy to say that January was probably the rockiest time of my whole year. I was struggling not only with the feeling that I had not properly utilized my first semester at MIT, but also with the stress of dealing with a relationship that I could see crumbling before my eyes. I had really thought I loved this person, with whom I was determined to live through four years of long distance, but I found that dealing with the fact that playing video games was more important than spending time with me, among other lifestyle differences, waxed quite difficult. At the end of my senior year of high school, I gave a speech to my graduating class in which I emphasized that, no matter what we do, we should place first and foremost the people in our lives, because no matter how much we would like to believe that our successes and our endeavors are a result of only ourselves, it is our parents, our friends, our mentors, our teachers, and our loved ones who made it all possible. We are social human beings. I think it's a tragedy when people consistently value their work or their leisure above the people who care for them, so to play the role of a victim to this very tragedy was a dark paradox. I probably cried enough from September to January to fill the well Buffalo Bill trapped his victims in. That was dark. So were those couple months. </p>
    
<h3> The First Hump </h3>
<p class = "indented">
   So when I left California in January, I did so extremely joyously. I bounced on the balls of my feet all the way back to Boston. I was ready to leave, and I was extremely excited to start my second semester at MIT. I was moving into a new dorm: East Campus, where I had dreamed of living since Campus Preview Weekend in April of 2015. Unfortunately, I opted for Maseeh my first semester out of fear of my parents' judging eyes, but after experiencing the lack of openness and community there, I knew I had to leave. Maseeh just wasn't for me. East Campus was. To me, it was like the entrance to heaven. I loved the people there. I loved the community. I loved the sense of openness and friendship surrounding me. To demonstrate, one of my friends from East Campus, Jessy, helped me move out of Maseeh; she spent all day (literally around 7 hours) helping me pack all my stuff and roll it cross-campus to EC, and she helped me through all of this even though it took two trips. Another person who I had just met, Wei, generously allowed me to leave my stuff in her room while she and I were away for IAP, because my room was still housed by its previous resident during IAP. Another person who I met at the beginning of first semester, Carina, helped move all my stuff up one floor to my actual room and went grocery shopping with me. Carina and Jessy also let me crash in their room for a couple of days until I was able to move into my own room. </p>
    
<p class = "indented">
The people from my hall as well as my friends from the hall below instantly embraced me with open arms, inviting me to lunches and dinners, and hanging out in my room, cooking with me, spending time with me, and making me feel at home. The very first weekend of the semester, I remember hanging out with friends from 2W. We played games, ran and chased each other in the snow, and then ended up in the lounge forming a huge jumbled circle, swaying and singing/yelling to "Piano Man." That night was particularly notable because there was this guy who would just not stop staring at me for a long time. This guy is important, and the story of that night is hilarious. I wish I could tell it but it is only for a select few ears to hear. But let's remember him as we go on. Anyway, I was also enamored with all four of my classes (though this varied throughout the semester for three of my classes, only the fourth class held significance for me: 6.101). The intensity of my love for East Campus, my friends, and my classes pulled me out of the raging sea of depression I was caught in my first semester. I valued human connection even more than I had ever before. </p>

<p class = "indented">
   Mid-February, I found myself competing in MakeMIT with a group of friends (Hi Nha, Evan, Jessy, and Carina). Those 24 hours were bittersweet. We built a discreet device that detects when the user has bad posture and provides haptic feedback (read: vibrates the crap out of your back) in the spots you need to correct until you are again upright with proper posture. It featured custom calibration and worked quite well... Except that it broke literally 1 minute before judging rounds, and of course, we were the team that had 5 judges come to us in the first 5 minutes only to be disappointedly sent away because we were experiencing "technical difficulties." When the results for the top ten (out of ~60 teams) came out, we were not on the list, and I was devastated. Absolutely devastated. If I couldn't make this back posture correcter work in 24 hours, then what were my skills even worth? After a couple days of reflection, I leaped over my sadness from this "failure" and felt happy that I was able to bond with my friends while creating an actually remarkable product, but this is just an example of how, sometimes, competition, especially at a place like MIT, can be overwhelming and emotionally draining. The weekend of MakeMIT was a long weekend so I left for New York City to visit my friends there and catch a break from what already felt like a roller coaster. New York was amazing. The wind clawed at my face as my friend, Cathy, and I walked all day through the city, but I reveled in the energy and beauty of the city nonetheless. Suddenly, an exciting thing occured the night before my trip back to MIT. I received a Facetime call from my friend Carina telling me that we had advanced to the next level in MakeMIT. We were 11th despite our last-minute troubles and got bumped up to the top ten when one of the teams said they would not attend the second round. I check my email and confirm this. WOW. Praise. Hail. Snow. Rain. I was so happy. </p>
    
<p class = "indented">
    So a week passes. My friend from Carnegie Melon, Rickie, visits me. MakeMIT Round 2 happens, and aha, we finish <a class="link" href="http://makemit.org/2016/review/index.html" target="_blank">second place overall</a> with our product, Align! Remember that guy I said that was important? He was on the team, along with a couple other friends I would soon grow to know and love, that won first place. They made an automatic hot-dog cooker. How sweet is that? With the renewed confidence of winning at MakeMIT, I gushed with happiness and excitement. Rickie and I had dinner, met up with some mutual high school friends who are also at MIT, and returned to EC. Now for a recipe. Take a super happy Farita, which is saying something because my default is happy. Add friends. Make sure these friends don't have much imminent work needing to be finished. Pour liberal amounts of ecstasy from having almost all the winners of the hackathon come from one hall in EC: 2W. Sprinkle with a bit of the lighthearted-ness still present near the beginning of the semester. Season with pumped up Lil Jon music on Nice-Rack. And there you have yourselves quite the rambunctious celebration of MakeMIT success. Whew, that was quite a night. Let's just say Rickie said he would never forget the hilarity of that night, and that some of my friends were very amused at me, including that guy I said was pretty important. </p>

<h3> A Dip in Sales </h3>
<p class = "indented">
   As the waves of spring semester rolled by, the climate did not. The weather, though milder than most Bostonian winters, simply sat plopped like a pouting toddler unwilling to leave the playground and drag itself to spring. Maybe my life caught up with the weather, because for a period of 1.5 months my relationship with friends experienced a cold front. Though, I will have to comment on the saving grace of two very important people in my life: two of my best friends (Shivani from GT, who I have been best friends with for over 9 years, and that very important guy I keep mentioning). As a side note and tribute, Shivani is half the reason I am able to survive through all the negativities in my life. A million thanks to her for always being my number one. Firstly, the crumbling rocks of my relationship placed me and my ex at the brink of break up. To make things worse, my extremely conservative parents found out about this relationship and threatened to cease my tuition payments. What a lovely mess I had on my hands. I was so upset and confused, and I have no idea how I was able to get my work done during that time. I talked to my friend Julian several times about my situation, and I am so extremely thankful for the advice he gave me, for it was one of the rare times that someone's advice has truly played a hugely significant role towards making me a happier person. </p>
    
<p class = "indented">
It took a week of pain and precautionary meetings with MIT Financial Aid and Admissions administrators for my parents to decide that they were being irrational, and they proceeded to embrace me with open arms, despite my deviances from the traditional Bengali Muslim way that they like to live their lives and that they would like me to live as well. My parents' sudden acceptance of me almost made me faint with happiness. I have never before felt so comfortable being truly open with them. They are now like best friends to me and I love them so much. Before I could truly grasp the beauty of this development however, Spring Break rolled around, and with it came the death of a salesman, if we say that the salesman is a first order approximation of my relationship with my ex. That was a tough time, but I was relieved by a much dragged-out end to an obviously failing relationship. It's over now, but I hope that we can be friends again one day. Pretty soon after, I began dating this very important guy I keep mentioning. It was a dream, so lovely and sweet, yet it felt so pragmatic and appropriate, despite increasing pressure from classes. Unfortunately, when I started dating Shankha, I started spending less time with my friends, though I didn't recognize this problem at first. Some of my relationships went downhill. I was extremely sad and extremely confused. I had no idea about certain issues that were going on and I wish my friends would have flat out told me, but I guess things are not so simple? Anyway, when I noticed that my relationships were taking a downward turn, I reached out to people, talked with them, and resolved things with all my lovely friends. Sometimes in the heat of the semester, small things can get thrown out of proportion, especially when they're left to fester untreated. I learned what it truly means to put issues "on the table," open up to people, be straightforward, and resolve conflict, especially with people whose personalities are pretty different from mine. People are pretty darn great, but communication and care are the key to true friendships. </p>
    
<h3> The Final Countdown </h3>
<p class = "indented">
The last 1.5 months of my freshman year at MIT. We can call upon Europe to explain this portion: The Final Countdown. Jack Florey was a thing, and it was successful, and I jumped on a trampoline for hours after it was over. I made new friends (Hannah, Peter, Mal, YC, Ben). I strengthened old ones. I love you Ava, and I hope you don't mind my ecstatic dancing and yelling in front of hordes of frosh eating donuts (frosh-eating donuts? while that would be interesting, I meant donut-eating frosh). </p>  
    
<p class = "indented">    
    Shankha and I visited New York together during Patriot's Day weekend, again relying on the amazing hospitality of Cathy. It is well known that Columbia has a beautiful campus and a renowned academic record, but is it known how hilarious Cathy and her friends are? Since Shankha and I visited together, they made lots of jokes and slipped a poster that read "Consent is Bae" under the door a couple hours after we arrived. Lovely people; they gave us quite a laugh and even had a toast in our honor. While in New York, Shankha and I walked all over ~ around 10 miles a day according to my handy dandy iOS health app. We probably visited and saw more things in New York than I saw when I visited for two weeks a couple years ago. Power couple! Also, I highly recommend just lying or walking in Central Park. Hours somehow fly away in this beautiful park. Its beauty is unfathomable. We also visited my aunt and her husband and two precious kids, and we were treated to my aunt's scrumptious dishes. No, not actual dishes, silly. These two days and the couple months of my relationship with Shankha have been inexplicably amazing. I could be cheesy and gushy here, and I usually am in person, but I think I'll leave it to the idea that I've never felt so truly close and connected with another person before while also retaining my own identity, independence, and confidence. He is also one of the rare people that consistently make me happy, and I'm completely awestruck by it. If I could describe our relationship in one word, it would probably be "wow." </p>

    These last couple weeks were an actual whirlwind. For our 6.101 (Analog Circuits Laboratory) final project, my friends and I decided to make a fluxgate magnetometer. I proposed the idea because I tried pursuing this in high school, but never truly went past the brainstorming stage. For the first three weeks of our project, things looked pretty hopeless, and we thought we would not have a working final project. In the last week, thanks to some advice from Joe Sousa of Linear Technology, the amazing support we received from Professor Gim Hom, and our combined efforts as a team, we finished our project and built a working fluxgate magnetometer. For details, read our report <a class="link" href="http://web.mit.edu/6.101/www/s2016/projects/farita_Project_Final_Report.pdf" target="_blank">here!</a> Gim was so happy with us that he called our project "baller af" (we have <a class="link" href="https://www.facebook.com/farida.tasneem.9/posts/1699878413599300?notif_t=like&notif_id=1463333219101298" target="_blank">video evidence!</a>) and we recieved a near perfect score on the final project, which apparently is very difficult to achieve for this class. Gim even wrote me a letter congratulating me on my performance on the final project and in 6.101 in general. How amazing. I am honored. That letter made my life complete. Also. Elena. Elena. Elena. I had to say her name three times because once is not enough. Feel free to bask in her amazingness. While she, Jack, and I were doing this final project together, I grew very close to Elena because we live in the same dorm, and we are both working at Microsoft Hololens as EE interns this summer. We even have the same manager, and we are roommates for the summer. Why is Elena amazing? Because she can kick butt in her classes and produce impactful work while dealing with a surgery on her broken thumb, while still making time to connect with and support her friends, while still being a joy to be around. I absolutely love her and am so excited to spend time together this summer. We'll actually also be taking two classes together next semester, so we joke about how she will never see the end of me. It's wonderful. </p>
    
<p class = "indented">
    There's so much to say about the last few weeks of the semester that I'm mostly going to end with thank you's and shout out's to the best of people (who I have not already described above). I haven't mentioned Natasha yet but the friendship that she showed me last semester was one of the biggest reasons I stayed at MIT despite being swallowed by depression. She helped show me that people are truly helpful and caring even when they are extremely busy with their own lives. We got dinner about three times a week last semester, and even after I moved to EC, we hung out about once a week. I just love how her smiles and happiness can match mine, and that's saying something because people always say I smile and laugh more than anyone else they know. We'll be in the Bay Area together this summer so I am so so excited about our hang-outs! Also, I'm super thankful to Kliment for all our late night deep talks, shared advice about relationships and life problems, and p-setting together. I met Kliment near the beginning of this semester when I was experiencing issues with my ex, and he has been caring, helpful, and hilarious since day 1. I'm excited to spend a couple weeks in Europe next summer with him as my guide! Praful and Akshat are probably two of the most down-to-earth and chill, yet genuinely lovely people I know. I loved all the Bollywood sing a-longs and catching random snippets of Hindi, and girl advice, and chairing and iHop on Akshat's birthday. Also Praful is so sweet; can't wait to hang out with him this summer as well. Evan is amazing because he remained my friend through everything, ever since the day we met during CPW. Regardless of whatever happened, he was always nice to me and acted as a rational arbiter. Chetan is the bomb diggity for going through "war" with me, and also for all the crufting he does. He is a Cruft God. I can't wait to see him when I visit LA this summer! Nha was the reason 6.002 was bearable, even funny. Thanks for to him for getting me ice cream and for hang-outs, random talks, and for that time he dramatically said "I am a GOD," when he finished the final lab in 002. Wei saved my head during NCWIT Summit, and it was super chill talking about classes, UROP's, and life with her and getting to know her better during that time. Rebecca is just an amazing person and her dedication to her work and her friends is truly admirable. Pretty much everyone that I interacted with was darn amazing, and I'm so thankful for you all. </p>
    
<p class = "indented">
    This semester was such a jumble of randomness, and this short summary does not even begin to do justice to my amazing friends, my crazy emotions, and my deepened passions. This summer and next year are going to be roller coasters, I'm sure. I'll try to blog much more regularly. I have planned an endless list of things (sewing, CAD'ing my future room and furniture I will make, planning a new club I'm starting, painting, singing, rock climbing, fire spinning, cooking, road tripping, hiking, raving, and so much more!). Anyway, I'm going to peace out because I'm literally going to be slaughtering an animal tomorrow, either a chicken or a goat. Thanks for reading, lovelies. </p>
    
<h2> 01.27.16 </h2>
<p class="indented"> 
    My last day at Stanford. Waves of a bittersweet flavor invade my head, crashing against the sandy shores of my cingulate gyrus, where the pangs of sadness attempt to demolish my happiness, whilst my prefrontal cortex is calling its backup guard to defend my sense of reason and happiness. I'm disappointed to leave this beautiful place, where sunny skies bloom in January, whereas the precious sun has completely wilted in Boston, and the memories of the magnificently fun times constantly tug at my heartstrings; however, I'm overwhelmingly excited at the thoughts of this upcoming semester at MIT! I'm moving out of Maseeh and into a lovely single on floorpi (3W) on East Campus, where 90% of my friends at MIT reside. Not only am I so excited to be living in such close proximity to my friends, but I'm also so absolutely excited to make a ton of new friends! East Campus is full of the most fun, most outgoing, most welcoming, most caring, most confident, most self-loving people I know, and I'm so super excited to be feeding off of everyone's energy and to share some of my own. </p>

<p class = "indented">
    I'm particularly excited to enjoin in this supportive community, because my inner spirit of self worth and self confidence is ready to go exponential! My first semester, I was battling an extremely absorbing and draining depression; this January, looking at the scars of my sadness--my uncontrollable sobs, my irrational thoughts, and my seemingly bipolar mood, remembering how I oscillated between extremely ecstatic and abysmally woeful--caused me infinitely more pain. I found myself crying day in and day out. Two days ago, however, I cut open my chest, pulled out my heart, and figured out exactly what was going wrong inside me. I realized I was latching my self worth onto the way others treated me, and I realized that this mindset was extremely depraving--it was slashing my self worth day by day. Since I figured out what I was doing and what I have to fix, I'm truly excited for the future, and I can sense my happiness because I have been more productive and able to muster up more motivation in the past few days than I have any day during my first semester. The magnificent thing about my recent revelation, however, is that I know I am my own person, and I am definitely worth more than the sum of other people's views of me. </p>


<h2> 01.14.16 </h2>
<p class="indented"> The bottom line is I miss math. A couple minutes ago I had this crazily wondrous flashback, like the kind of flashback where I remember a time when I was the happiest and most motivated that I've ever been, as if I was Hercules arduously setting forth on a journey to complete the 12 labors, but really I'm just me, and that heroic quest is a set of difficult, mind-racking math problems from past AIME's. I want to feel passion like I felt it then, and I want to feel it all the time, or at least some of the time? Please? I guess I am trying to figure out what I've been missing, you know. It's sort of like I'm Holden Caulfield in his confused journey to "adulthood," or at least an understanding of yourself so great you are completely happy with your life. I have felt like that before when I was discovering my passion for electrical engineering, except I'm doing it all over again now that I've started college, and I guess it just feels oddly disorienting, since I've been pretty oriented with myself for the past several years. Maybe making money and having to actually take care of myself, filling in all the things my mother would do for me was a shocker. </p>

<p class = "indented">See, I feel so jaded, and I'm confused as to why I allow the waves of sloth to roll in and burn out the embers of my now-ephemeral passions. It seems as though nowadays, all I'm looking for is a way out. A way to end my worries and simply "be free," though I've come to realize that such "freedom" comes at the price of feeling true zeal. I want to be full of burning motivators again, even if that means being a geek happily solving math problems.</p>
    
 <p class = "indented">
	The advice I wrote to myself in October was good inspiration, but now it's time to actually follow my passions and accomplish things that are meaningful to me. The element of discovery and creation are most prominent on my list of things that make me happy. I'll go with that. I'll start slowly and attempt to tackle my demons one at a time whilst trekking the path to living life not freely, but fully.</p>

<h2> 10.25.15 </h2>
<p class="indented"> People cannot be quantified. Each individual person is a sum of their experiences, their actions, and their morals. Numbers are important in the sense that they provide some standard of measure of comparative comfort with certain tasks, realms of knowledge, etc; however, people are truly defined by their actions and their adventures. What someone wakes up and actively accomplishes and experiences is immensely more important than what score they make on an exam, how many hours they spent on their homework, and other such trivial things. Sure, school is a necessity because our society has deemed achieving a degree as a standard of measure of attaining a certain skill level in a given field of interest, and sure, we can’t quite blame society for adopting this standard of measure, for it saves time in determining better candidates for job roles, and for general credibility,  when you have a degree from a top university. This is a constant, but consider the case that many top university students are applying to highly sought after job positions, scholarships, awards, honors, whatever it is, and suddenly you’re just one fish in a big pond. </p>

<p class = "indented">How much more impressive would it be if you could talk to people about the amazingly interesting and crazy experiences you’ve had in your life because you simply love to enjoy life? Suddenly an interview in which you’re asked to discuss your interests transforms from a boring conversation about a project you completed in a class in perhaps an honorably unique way, or an award you won due to academic merit, into a much more engrossing conversation about a backpacking trip you took in Japan in which you rode around with a professor you met a karaoke bar and ended up collaborating with him on a project to transform how artificial intelligence takes place at the IC level, or about a trip you took to California on whim, meeting random people at Golden Gate park, and spending the rest of the evening creating jams from an audio mixer you create on the spot, because you’re the type of person who carries all the components needed to create an audio mixer in your backpack. How wonderful, how cool. Meeting people is such an important quality. Talking to people, really getting to know them, being interested in them, and sharing cool life experiences, having conversations about philosophy and random cool stuff, and then following up with hangouts, and creating shared experiences will lead to so many cool adventures. This is the way to live. Live fully. Embrace people. Make mistakes. Do crazy things you wouldn’t imagine doing before, within your moral limits, though, and live life fully. </p>
 <p class = "indented">
	This is my advice to myself. From now on, I do what I want. I create the experiences I want in life. I am happy, and that is a conscious choice I’m making.</p>
