<h2> 01.27.16 </h2>
<p class="indented"> 
    My last day at Stanford. Waves of a bittersweet flavor invade my head, crashing against the sandy shores of my cingulate gyrus, where the pangs of sadness attempt to demolish my happiness, whilst my prefrontal cortex is calling its backup guard to defend my sense of reason and happiness. I'm disappointed to leave this beautiful place, where sunny skies bloom in January, whereas the precious sun has completely wilted in Boston, and the memories of the magnificently fun times constantly tug at my heartstrings; however, I'm overwhelmingly excited at the thoughts of this upcoming semester at MIT! I'm moving out of Maseeh and into a lovely single on floorpi (3W) on East Campus, where 90% of my friends at MIT reside. Not only am I so excited to be living in such close proximity to my friends, but I'm also so absolutely excited to make a ton of new friends! East Campus is full of the most fun, most outgoing, most welcoming, most caring, most confident, most self-loving people I know, and I'm so super excited to be feeding off of everyone's energy and to share some of my own. </p>

    I'm particularly excited to enjoin in this supportive community, because the inner spirit of self-worth and self-confidence is ready to go exponential! My first semester, I was battling an extremely absorbing and draining depression; this January, looking at the scars of my sadness--my uncontrollable sobs, my irrational thoughts, and my seemingly bipolar mood, remembering how I oscillated between extremely happy mood and abysmally sad mood--caused me infinitely more pain. I found myself crying day in and day out. Two days ago, however, I cut open my chest, pulled out my heart, and figured out exactly what was going wrong inside me. I realized I was latching my self worth onto other people's treatment of me, and I realized that this mindset was extremely depraving and slashed my self worth day by day; the magnificent thing about this recent revelation, however, is that I am my own person, and I am definitely worth more than the sum of other people's views of me. </p>

<p class="indented"> The bottom line is I miss math. A couple minutes ago I had this crazily wondrous flashback, like the kind of flashback where I remember a time when I was the happiest and most motivated that I've ever been, as if I was Hercules arduously setting forth on a journey to complete the 12 labors, but really I'm just me, and that heroic quest is a set of difficult, mind-racking math problems from past AIME's. I want to feel passion like I felt it then, and I want to feel it all the time, or at least some of the time? Please? I guess I am trying to figure out what I've been missing, you know. It's sort of like I'm Holden Caulfield in his confused journey to "adulthood," or at least an understanding of yourself so great you are completely happy with your life. I have felt like that before when I was discovering my passion for electrical engineering, except I'm doing it all over again now that I've started college, and I guess it just feels oddly disorienting, since I've been pretty oriented with myself for the past several years. Maybe making money and having to actually take care of myself, filling in all the things my mother would do for me was a shocker. </p>

<p class = "indented">See, I feel so jaded, and I'm confused as to why I allow the waves of sloth to roll in and burn out the embers of my now-ephemeral passions. It seems as though nowadays, all I'm looking for is a way out. A way to end my worries and simply "be free," though I've come to realize that such "freedom" comes at the price of feeling true zeal. I want to be full of burning motivators again, even if that means being a geek happily solving math problems.</p>
    
 <p class = "indented">
	The advice I wrote to myself in October was good inspiration, but now it's time to actually follow my passions and accomplish things that are meaningful to me. The element of discovery and creation are most prominent on my list of things that make me happy. I'll go with that. I'll start slowly and attempt to tackle my demons one at a time whilst trekking the path to living life not freely, but fully.</p>

<h2> 10.25.15 </h2>
<p class="indented"> People cannot be quantified. Each individual person is a sum of their experiences, their actions, and their morals. Numbers are important in the sense that they provide some standard of measure of comparative comfort with certain tasks, realms of knowledge, etc; however, people are truly defined by their actions and their adventures. What someone wakes up and actively accomplishes and experiences is immensely more important than what score they make on an exam, how many hours they spent on their homework, and other such trivial things. Sure, school is a necessity because our society has deemed achieving a degree as a standard of measure of attaining a certain skill level in a given field of interest, and sure, we can’t quite blame society for adopting this standard of measure, for it saves time in determining better candidates for job roles, and for general credibility,  when you have a degree from a top university. This is a constant, but consider the case that many top university students are applying to highly sought after job positions, scholarships, awards, honors, whatever it is, and suddenly you’re just one fish in a big pond. </p>

<p class = "indented">How much more impressive would it be if you could talk to people about the amazingly interesting and crazy experiences you’ve had in your life because you simply love to enjoy life? Suddenly an interview in which you’re asked to discuss your interests transforms from a boring conversation about a project you completed in a class in perhaps an honorably unique way, or an award you won due to academic merit, into a much more engrossing conversation about a backpacking trip you took in Japan in which you rode around with a professor you met a karaoke bar and ended up collaborating with him on a project to transform how artificial intelligence takes place at the IC level, or about a trip you took to California on whim, meeting random people at Golden Gate park, and spending the rest of the evening creating jams from an audio mixer you create on the spot, because you’re the type of person who carries all the components needed to create an audio mixer in your backpack. How wonderful, how cool. Meeting people is such an important quality. Talking to people, really getting to know them, being interested in them, and sharing cool life experiences, having conversations about philosophy and random cool stuff, and then following up with hangouts, and creating shared experiences will lead to so many cool adventures. This is the way to live. Live fully. Embrace people. Make mistakes. Do crazy things you wouldn’t imagine doing before, within your moral limits, though, and live life fully. </p>
 <p class = "indented">
	This is my advice to myself. From now on, I do what I want. I create the experiences I want in life. I am happy, and that is a conscious choice I’m making.</p>
