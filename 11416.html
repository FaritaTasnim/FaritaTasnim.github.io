<h2> 01.14.16 </h2>
<p class="indented"> The bottom line is I miss math. A couple minutes ago I had this crazily wondrous flashback, like the kind of flashback where I remember a time when I was the happiest and most motivated that I've ever been, as if I was Hercules arduously setting forth on a journey to complete the 12 labors, but really I'm just me, and that heroic quest is a set of difficult, mind-racking math problems from past AIME's. I want to feel passion like I felt it then, and I want to feel it all the time, or at least some of the time? Please? I guess I am trying to figure out what I've been missing, you know. It's sort of like I'm Holden Caulfield in his confused journey to "adulthood," or at least an understanding of yourself so great you are completely happy with your life. I have felt like that before when I was discovering my passion for electrical engineering, except I'm doing it all over again now that I've started college, and I guess it just feels oddly disorienting, since I've been pretty oriented with myself for the past several years. Maybe making money and having to actually take care of myself, filling in all the things my mother would do for me was a shocker. </p>

<p class = "indented">See, I feel so jaded, and I'm confused as to why I allow the waves of sloth to roll in and burn out the embers of my now-ephemeral passions. It seems as though nowadays, all I'm looking for is a way out. A way to end my worries and simply "be free," though I've come to realize that such "freedom" comes at the price of feeling true zeal. I want to be full of burning motivators again, even if that means being a geek happily solving math problems.</p>
    
 <p class = "indented">
	The advice I wrote to myself in October was good inspiration, but now it's time to actually follow my passions and accomplish things that are meaningful to me. The element of discovery and creation are most prominent on my list of things that make me happy. I'll go with that. I'll start slowly and attempt to tackle my demons one at a time whilst trekking the path to living life not freely, but fully.</p>
