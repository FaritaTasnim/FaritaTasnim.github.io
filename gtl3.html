   Shalom from week two in Israel!</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   The big question of the week: will Amalia’s weight gain be net positive or net negative by the end of the month? </p>
    
<p class = "indented">
   In other words, my time thus far has been an unceasing cycle of stuffing myself with Israeli food followed by lots and lots of walking (though after a few too many falafel, the “walking” feels a lot more like rolling). </p>
    
<p class = "indented">
   So let’s start the exploration of my current conundrum by examining my one true love: food. Long story short, the food in Israel has been phenomenal. How can a single country have such beautiful, filling, and inexpensive food? Take the humble falafel as an example. It is an unassuming morsel, a simple mix of chick peas, onion, and various other spices.  Yet nestled alongside other condiments in a warm cradle of pita or laffa, these little spheres of golden-brown goodness are bold, unashamed of their rich and flavorful personality. </p>
    
<div class="video"><img src = "/images/amalia1.png" style="width:500px;"></img></div>
    
<p class = "indented">
  But you don’t even need to dole out your life savings to savor such sustenance! No, falafel can be found on nearly any street corner for a dozen or so shekels. In a trip to Old Jaffa, I found 10 shekel falafel (around $2.60) and a new friend in the shopkeeper, who exclaimed that he loved me as he handed over the deep-fried goodness (note to self, Israelis are very blunt and very affectionate). 
</p>
    
<p class = "indented">
   And this, my friend, is not the extent of Israeli food. I have merely scratched the surface with my few flings with falafel, shawarma, and shakshuka. Israel has a short but rich history of peoples from all over the world gathering, and in doing so, blending and creating hybrid cultures. And, of course, food.  </p>

   Food has not been the only force in my life here in Israel. Perhaps it’s my lack of sherut (or shared taxis) knowledge, or maybe somehow a new drive to be fit has kicked in, but walking has become a significant part of my life. Just this past Friday in Haifa, I climbed a small mountain (no big deal, really). Then later that same day, my friends and I missed our alighting point and found ourselves at a bus station, kilometers away from our housing on top of (yet another) mountain. 
</p>
    
<p class = "indented">
   No car? No big deal. What else are legs for?
</p>
    
<div class="video"><img src = "/images/amalia3.png" style="width:500px;"></img></div>
    
<p class = "indented">
   Two hours (and 83 floors) later, we were back home. As tiring as the walk may have been, it was a stunning experience. As Shabbat settled in with an inky dusk sky, the streets quieted as cars hummed, stalled, then stopped. Families, clusters of children, and gatherings of Orthodox Jewish men stepped out into the streets as the setting sun signaled the weekly day of rest. Every now and then, as our group stopped to catch our breath, we would turn around and look from the mountain onto the homes perched on the hill and the expanse of buildings down below. At each stop, the sun was slightly lower and the street lamps a little brighter, twinkling over a quieting city.

   Maybe taking a taxi would have been more convenient and less tiring. Maybe I would have looked a little less unkempt for Shabbat dinner, but walking the streets of Israel has provided a beautiful and intimate glimpse at life in Israel. The laundry softly waving from apartment balconies or the curious face peering from a window may have been passing, but each small encounter was special. 
</p>
    
<p class = "indented">
   And stomach.
