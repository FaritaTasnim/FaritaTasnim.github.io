   School starts tomorrow. Tomorrow we sit in front of students of variable English levels and introduce ourselves, tell them about our lives, and begin to unpack all the fun things we have planned for the past months. Will we have boiled things down to the teaching level from the level we have it stored in our heads? Will we be able to express it so that most of the students, regardless of English level can learn and enjoy the class. Only tomorrow will tell.

   Will I have more to teach the students, or will they have more to teach me? We are in their culture. This area that I’ve only heard about in the Bible, in books, or in History Channel documentaries is their home. I brought hopefully very fun physics, but they know the culture we are immersed in. We may be masters of the classroom back home, but this is their classroom, and we are not back home. Do we remember how to be in high school?

   For me, tomorrow brings me to two English classes, where I will just tell them about myself. I will talk about MIT and what I do; I’ll talk about my research at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. I’ll talk about where I’ve been, where I’m going, and how engineering and physics brought me on the ride of my life. Hopefully I can show the students a little of what inspired me.

   *Update: first day of teaching went great! They love me!
