<h2> 01.13.17 </h2>

<p class="indented"> 
   This week, Tiffany, Zach, Alex, Amalia, Farita, and I (Hannah) arrived in Ashdod, Israel, settled into our living arrangements at ORT Yami, and got our first introduction to teaching at our schools.
 </p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   We arrived several days before we began teaching, giving us ample time to meet the students at our dormitories. We have received a warm welcome, with many students wanting to tell us about Israel, show us around Ashdod, and get to know us. It has been quite the experience becoming acquainted with culture of the school and the country.
 </p>

<p class = "indented">
   We quickly found that many of the things we were told to expect were true: the students were very direct, open, and informal. However, none of us could have been prepared for how prevalent these traits are. Frequently, the students’ first questions for us are quite personal: What do you think of Israel? What do you think of Donald Trump? Do you have a boyfriend? Do you do drugs? Are you Jewish? However, this has been a great way to start real conversations. We talk about politics, religion, and culture over dinner in the dining hall almost every night, with an openness that is hard to find in the United States. This has allowed us to learn a lot about each other in the very short time we’ve been here.
 </p>

   We were also surprised how “aggressive” the students were, though in a benign way. For one, it seems like the most common way to communicate here is by shouting. We often see kids play fighting in the courtyard, calling each other names, and pushing through crowds to get to food first. In fact, many times we have found ourselves waiting in “line”, when truly no line existed and they were probably wondering why we were awkwardly standing around. Still, it is clear that there is a lot of camaraderie between students and respect for their peers.
 </p>

   It has also been very interesting for us to be involved in the many activities hosted by our boarding school. We celebrated the beginning of Shabbat with a feast, watched American movies with the students during their movie night, and even enjoyed a concert put on by a band from the Israeli Navy. The campus is very lively and there is never a shortage things to be done.
 </p>
    
<p class = "indented">
   We are just now getting started with our teaching assignments, and I (and probably all of the others as well), look forward to getting to know our students and neighbors even more.
