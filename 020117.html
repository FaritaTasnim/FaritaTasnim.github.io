<h3> Israel was Unreal, in the Best and Worst of Ways </h3>
<p class="indented"> 
   In which I summarize my IAP of teaching under MIT MISTI GTL Israel for a month. </p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   My time in Israel, like much of the terrain here, was mountainous. </p>

<p class="indented"> 
   Hilly. And I mean that in the craziest way possible.</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   I climbed up unexpected hurdles, with sand in my eyes, and, yet, also clear-headedly enjoyed many lush valley oases.</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   Upon my arrival in Israel, I decided to join my boyfriend, Shankha, and his housemate for the month (who by the way turned out to be an amazing friend), Kelsey, in Jerusalem since I knew transportation in the small town of Ashdod, the town I was assigned to teach in, would be sparse past midnight on Friday. I was windswept by Jerusalem - by the city, and especially by the Old City. The markets in the Old City reminded me of the lovely chaotic nature of Bengali markets. While exploring Jerusalem, I had the lucky pleasure of getting to know the MEET instructors, Lorenzo and Ted, at the same time as Shankha and Kelsey. </p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   Our first day in Israel, Lorenzo took us all to a lovely shawarma place, which I later visited twice, and whose owner still recognizes me and winks at me every time he sees me walk by his restaurant (sweet connections such as these with strangers make my day). At the little shawarma shop, Lorenzo told us about MEET students, including some of the challenges of working with both Israeli and Palestinian students as well as the methods by which they get the two groups - and different genders - to mingle and form lasting friendships. He mentioned that sometimes students unknowingly say or do things that people from the opposite group find offensive, and for this reason, MEET started a separate set of courses for the students called “Deeper Understanding,” targeted to help students understand the culture and history of their counterpart in the region. </p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   The more I learned about MEET, the more I fell in love with it - it is truly a beautiful program whose purpose is to bring together Israelis and Palestinians through computer science and entrepreneurship education. Through this program, students develop skills that will help them in their future careers, but more importantly, I think it helps students develop a compassion and a humane understanding of the situation of the land they are growing up in, which is truly vital in developing Israel’s future leaders who can help this turbulent country take steps not only in technology, but also in achieving peace. By the time I had to leave for Ashdod, I was seriously jealous of Shankha and Kelsey… But who knew, maybe my experience would be just as great. Still, as I stepped off the train when it arrived in Ashdod, I kept a realistic view that things might not go as I expected… and boy, was I right (much to my dismay).</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   When I came to ORT Yami, the school I would be teaching at, I was greeted by the five other MIT students there, who so wonderfully formed their first impression on me by nagging me for not setting up a wifi hotspot for them - because I got a great deal in Jerusalem of SIM card + 6GB for a month = 70 NIS, and subsequently calling our group leader a “bad leader” for not forcing me to set up a wifi hotspot. Well, this would be a swell set of “friends”! </p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   Our first official meeting was on Monday, 1/9, with our teachers. Everyone’s teachers were present for the whole meeting and displayed great enthusiasm to embrace the teaching caliber of MIT students hoping to make an impact on students in Israel…. except my teacher, who, to this rather important meeting, showed up an hour late and left 15 minutes early. Then, for the time that each teacher was supposed to set up a weekly schedule with their respective student(s), mine only discussed very vague and general topics of what I could teach and started showing me videos of elementary wave energy generators. When I brought up the topic of setting a schedule, he said to me, quote, “It’s fineeee. We’ll figure it out later.” I responded with “That leaves me confused. I cannot teach without a schedule…”, to which he responded “No, no it’s okay. Why are you confused? Don’t worry.” And promptly left to go to another “impromptu” meeting… and guess what! It gets better! This behavior was not just a first impression but actually exactly how this teacher always is - at all times! My internal voice who soothed me by pointing out that perhaps the teacher is just having a rough day and is currently very busy, but will get back to me with a schedule tomorrow, was, to say it nicely, OH. SO. WRONG. Yes, all caps was necessary there.</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   10:20 AM the next day. Loud knocks on my door. “Farita, wake up!! Your teacher wants you to teach a class in 40 minutes!” What… Okay, so I wake up and frantically send a text to my teacher asking what I’m supposed to teach… No response. Okay, I get ready anyway. </p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   10:50 AM. Reply: “You’ll be teaching Technical English.” - no explanation. </p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   Me internally: Okay. Lovely. I guess I’ll find out what exactly the heck that means and wing it.  </p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   Waiting and waiting for 25 minutes, I get a bit frustrated. Finally the teacher shows up. I ask him, “I thought the class was at 11 AM?”. He replies, and keep in mind this was at 11:25, “Oh no, it’s actually at 11:15 AM.”</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   Me internally: Okay, it’s okay. Whew, just collect yourself, it’ll be fine. Forget the lack of planning, the lack of communication, the lack of organization, the lack of transparency… Apparently this is supposed to be normal for Israelis. It’ll be okay soon. It’ll all be okay soon… (looking back, I realize maybe I should have dismissed the teacher then and there as unfit to work with and switched to a different teacher).</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   It turns out that this Technical English class is supposed to teach students (who are in their first year of college, by the way) how to read and understand English datasheets for electronic components such as op-amps. Okay, I can do this. This is not what I came here to teach, but I had learned an immense amount about reading and understanding datasheets from my high school EE mentor and figured I could help impart my knowledge to the students. So, I taught the hour-long class with 0 preparation, and it actually went well. I was happy with myself, and the students, I could tell, really enjoyed my presence and my teaching. </p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   After the class, I asked the teacher (I will just call him “the teacher“ so as to not mention names) when the next class would be and if he could please set up a schedule for teaching with me. And he replied,  “Sure, don’t worry. I’ll send it to you tonight.“ My heart gave a little jump of joy… Finally, I’ll get a schedule tonight!</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   “Tonight”: No schedule. No word from the teacher.</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   Next morning: I woke up to words from the teacher: “Hey, come teach at 9 AM today. And give a presentation on your ocean wave energy harvester at 2 PM.” </p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   I show up at 9 AM… wait for 30 minutes… No sign of the teacher. So I text him and also the coordinator for us MIT students at ORT Yami: “Why is there no class now?” The supervisor texts back saying, “Oh sorry, go to the teacher’s class at 11 AM.” Alright, so I show up again at - 11:15 AM this time because I knew what 11 AM actually meant by now. Again, I wait for 30 minutes, and finally one of my students asks me what I’m doing and lets me know that the teacher is not here today. Now, I can’t hold it in any longer. My eyes grow large with anger. I try cooling myself down, again with that foolishly optimistic voice in my head… “Maybe this week is just tough for the teacher…” Since I was told the teacher was not present that day, I figured my 2 PM presentation was also cancelled… and besides, I was never told in which room to give my presentation in anyway. So, I went to go take a nap and calm my soul.</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   6 PM: I wake up from my nap to texts from the teacher asking about if I’d be there for the 2 PM presentation. I calmly told him that he did not show up to the first two classes I was supposed to teach and did not inform me beforehand, I was told by the students that that he was not present today at the school, and so I believed what I was actually told, and took a nap. Sorry for the inconvenience. And please inform me of any changes at least 12 hours beforehand. “Thumbs up emoji,“ he responds.</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   Wednesday night, I ask about Thursday classes and get no response. On Thursday day. I run into the teacher, inquire again about classes and setting a schedule, to which he tells me, yet again, “Don’t worry. It’ll be fine. I’ll tell you later.” I nudge him, “Yes, please tell me very soon. I need to know in order to teach properly.” Later, at 4 pm, I am hanging outside the school building with my students, and the teacher shows up, saying, “Oh great you’re here! I have an ‘impromptu’ meeting, so I can’t make my class that is scheduled for right now. Please teach them something, anything.” All the while, my internal voice is telling me to calm down, to chill. Okay, so I try to teach the students, but of course they start rejoicing that another class got cancelled and don’t want to learn much other than english names for electronic components. Still, I try to at least inspire some awe in them, by guiding their thoughts to the realization that they are so lucky to be studying electrical engineering because it forms the foundations of the “magic” that makes their phones, and any device really, run so smoothly. </p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   That night, three other Ashdod people and I head to Haifa for a weekend trip in north Israel. It was an okay trip. I got to see the Ba’hai Gardens in Haifa and the Citadel and Old City in Akko. Still, the highlight of my weekend was probably drawing an intricate rose-window-inspired design on my hand with henna. I was really itching to produce something of value, and this henna was the first productive thing I did in Israel, or at least that’s how it felt. I messaged my teacher asking about teaching details for Sunday, and I was told there were no plans. So Saturday night, I decided to go to Jerusalem to visit Shankha and Kelsey again. On top of this, I started feeling sick on Friday in Haifa, and by Sunday it was a fully brewed storm of sneezing, buckets of mucus, nose peeling from tissue usage, coughing, headaches, and generally feeling unable to do anything. So, Monday, I stayed in Jerusalem as well because I didn’t feel well enough to travel. </p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   On Tuesday, I traveled back to Ashdod, though I was still sick, and though I knew I would be greeted by more lack of planning and organization. I set up a meeting with the teacher to try to actually solidify a schedule. He showed up thirty minutes late to the meeting - at this point, I’m no longer surprised. For the next hour, he very inefficiently tried to set up a schedule. More than half of the classes that he put in my schedule were with other teachers who I later found out didn’t even know that students from MIT had come to teach at ORT Yami… How was I supposed to teach with these teachers, and without any introduction from “the teacher” between us, and without any dialogue or form of communication to understand what the students are learning, what they have learned so far, and what they need to be taught (where I come in)? I also voiced all these concerns to him, to which he responded with, “Don’t worry I will introduce you to these people and set up these dialogues.” And… he didn’t.</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   So of course, week 2 went just as (not) smoothly as week 1. I was still only really teaching for 3-4 hours a week, and for the rest of the classes, I was watching the other teachers give their lessons. How much am I expected to politely push someone and also inform their supervisor - while the whole time, despite my pushes and pleas nothing changes? I was very disheartened. I think anybody in my situation would have felt the same way. 
    </p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   Ashdod incited in me a highly volatile medley of feelings. I loved my students dearly, and I could tell they loved me as well. They loved to have me in class, and to hang out with me after class, to have deep conversations, to talk politics and religion while still strengthening a short-term “best buds” relationship, to just chill by the beach, to treat me to ice cream… My students were amazing and I so wish I had more time with them. Unfortunately, my teaching situation was so disorganized and chaotic that I grew extremely frustrated with the teacher and the management in the Ashdod schools. Call me a control freak but honestly I think anyone who grew up in a culture where dedication to your work is extremely important (doubly important for me, coming from Bangladesh, being raised by Bangladeshi parents, and also growing up in the United States) would have more than just a hard time in my situation. </p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   Nonetheless, after week 2, I took another hiatus in Jerusalem. This time, we had Thursday off as well for an organized MIT trip that I felt way too down to attend. After a day in Jerusalem, however, I felt very positive knowing that I have a long break. Thankfully Shankha and Kelsey were staying in an Airbnb, so it gave me a prime time to cook 3.5 kg of goat and chicken curry, as well as eggplant dry curry and Indo-Chinese mushroom curry. Most of the weekend, Shankha was away in Jordan, so I took this time to connect more with Kelsey, who I have grown to love, and who inspires me with her deep passion for education, especially in low-income and disadvantaged neighborhoods. I’ve learned a lot from her, and I truly appreciate her greatness as a human being. </p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   The Saturday of this (third) weekend was also amazing. Sadeq, another MEET instructor, took me, Kelsey, and Ted, to his house, where he and his parents filled us to the brim with makloobeh, fruits, tea, sweets, and great conversation. I swear my stomach was about to burst open (in a way that I was totally fine with) as we were leaving his house to go meet Lorenzo. In Bethlehem, Lorenzo showed us around and took us to meet some of his friends. That night was one of my most fun of all time, and definitely the most fun here in Israel. We all chatted a bunch, danced to Arabian music, and I got to know his hilarious and lovely friends. (Apparently the next time Kelsey and the others took a trip to Bethlehem, Lorenzo’s friends asked about me and missed me ~ Aww, my heart goes out to them!). On Sunday, Shankha returned from Jordan. We hung out, and I returned to Ashdod on Tuesday. </p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   On the way back to Ashdod, I came close to breaking down mentally again, however, given that I knew that I had to return to my personal hell. That night, the ORT Yami supervisor as well as the people in charge of this MIT-Ashdod connection called “the teacher” and lectured him as to why he needs to be serious about my teaching. They set up a meeting for Wednesday at 8:15 AM. When I arrive at the teacher’s lounge for the meeting, at which the principal of ORT Yami was supposed to attend, but never showed up, the teacher told me he had another impromptu meeting and would be back at 9 AM and while I wait, I should teach some random new class he threw at me. Meanwhile, one of the MIT-Ashdod collaboration directors already arrived for the meeting, and waited with me until 9:30 AM for the teacher to come back from his “impromptu” meeting. She even had to cancel a meeting she had at another school at 9 AM. So at this point, we are all furious, and it’s obvious that the teaching problems that have been going on are not my fault. </p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   Finally, in the meeting, I put my foot down and made it clear that I want to be teaching with another teacher instead of “the teacher,” and since then teaching has been great, despite that “the teacher“ still wanted me to teach some classes with him, and still often threw new classes at me half an hour to a couple hours maximum prior to the class. I dealt with it, but since I was mostly working under a different teacher, things were going fine. During my fourth and last weekend, Shankha and I made samosas for his students and spent some good time together.</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   Now, the final disaster of my time in Israel has struck. This past Monday, I had lunch at the cafeteria in ORT Yami - some sesame chicken that was either undercooked or left out for too long. In the middle of the night at 4 AM, I woke up to a severely aching stomach. I got up and washed my face, but I could barely walk. I decided to just lay down and hopefully it’d be fine by the morning. At 6 AM, I got up and took a shower. I was okay, but then I threw up and the nausea started all over again. The pain mounted until I could not walk except for the 15 feet I had to walk to get to the bathroom. I lay in bed all day, and though my roommate knew about this, she nor any of the others did anything at all to help. Though I asked for them to kindly bring me some fruit because I could barely walk, none of them made even the slightest effort to help. I began mentally breaking down again not only due to the nonchalance around me, but also because I had no means to help myself. The boarding school I was staying in had no kitchen, no supermarket closer than 15 minutes walk away, and no people to provide even mental support for me. Before things could again take a turn for the worse, I decided this Wednesday morning to leave for Jerusalem to recover fully before my flight, during which I seriously do not wish to be physically or mentally ill. Here, my boyfriend bought groceries for me and took care of me. And I have a kitchen to cook, a comfortable bed, hot water at all times, and people around who actually care.</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   My flight back to the U.S. is in two days and I could not be more anxious for Friday 7 AM to come. Peace, and, bye, Israel. Though this has been one of my toughest times, I have come out a stronger and mentally much healthier person. Most of the time, people didn’t take care of me. So I started actually taking care of myself, my body, and my mind, which is something that I have been trying to do since I started college at MIT… I finally feel like I’m starting to develop the skill of taking care of myself in a sustainable way. And if nothing else, that alone made by trip to Israel worth it. </p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   And as a final note:</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   To those who judged me for not being in Ashdod half the time, or who blamed me for the lack of organization and planning, or made me feel bad because of a situation that I could hardly control despite all my efforts… To those, who, when I was sick and I asked for some help in obtaining food, complained that there were no paper plates in sight, that there was nothing they could do… To those who cold-heartedly turned their backs on me while they could obviously see my pain and suffering… I hope you realize now…</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   That I tried my hardest. My absolute (I really want to insert a swear word here) hardest within the bounds of what I could do.</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   That I fought every single day. And not just a battle of words, conversations, and meetings trying to get order and schedule from the teacher, but also an internal battle trying to ward off the ghosts of depression and mental issues that plagued me this past semester, the demons who began to start haunting me again during this past month given my weakness in newly found times of trouble. </p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   That I cried for more than half my days in Israel.</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   That I hid it from you all because I knew you would have no sympathy.</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   That I deeply tried to form connections with people. And you know what, I did. My students loved me. They kept in contact with me, they sympathized with my sicknesses, with my frustrations with the teacher, and they are what kept me going and prevented me from just outright quitting. </p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   That my best interactions in Ashdod (other than those with my students) were with taxi drivers. At least complete strangers there were nice. </p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   That I went at least 5 days where all I ate was bread due to the poor quality of food in the cafeteria in ORT Yami. And none of you cared.</p>

<p class="indented"> 
   That I tolerated being around you guys despite your obvious judging, complete lack of care and sympathy for my situation, reluctant will to help me at all during my sicknesses, or even give me a simple darn “How are you today, Farita?” You didn’t even pretend to care. </p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   That if you claim you’re a devout Christian or a self-proclaimed great person and yet you do not even know how to be a decent, caring human being, a good neighbor, a good roommate, a good friend, or, leave all that - at least a humane person who tries to at least pretend to offer help to others suffering next to you - then I’m sorry you have a lot more work to do before you can be accepted to your “heaven.” Belief in God is not enough and I hope you know that. Though I’m not religious, I used to be for 16 years, and if there’s one truth that I learned, it’s that your good deeds, whether or not someone or something is actually tallying them, are measured by the happiness you create in others, or cut by the pain you cause in others. I’m not saying I’m perfect in this matter, but this is just a simple matter of human goodness that we should all be trying to improve.</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   I hope, if you read this or not, that you now realize. </p>
