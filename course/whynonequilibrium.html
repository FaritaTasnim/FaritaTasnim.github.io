        Why we need to expand to nonequilibrium statistical physics

            <p> The truth of the matter is that no actual dynamical system (an animal, a society, an economy, an ecosystem) we are interested in exists in equilibrium. No such system can be isolated from the rest of the universe. Additionally all such systems are subject to constant and constantly changing flows of energy. We are also interested in how these systems evolve, not just what the values of certain properties are in their hypothetical steady states.  <br> <br> </p> 
            
            <p> Under a recently emerging framework called nonequilibrium statistical physics, we are able to start to extend the statistical concepts from equilibrium physics to the nonequilibrium realm. Instead of considering ensembles and probabilities of systems in different states, what do you think the ensembles and probabilities in nonequliibrium statistical physics involves? Naturally, it considers probabilities of different *trajectories* the system could take under some dynamical constraints. Nonequilibrium statistical physics allows an analysis of how changing dynamical constraints changes the probabilities of different trajectories. Additionally, instead of considering the steady state energy or entropy, it considers energy flows and entropy flows. This allows us to study how changing dynamical constraints changes how much energy a system consumes and how much of that it wastes. It further allows one to study the implications for these results on the most energy-efficient strategies for a system performing some function. Indeed, <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04320" target = "_blank"><b>very recent research</b></a> has has used a branch of nonequillibrium statistical physics, called stochastic thermodynamics, has uncovered fundamental reasons why systems that communicate information (e.g., neurons, cellular communication, societies, etc.) tend to split their informaiton streams across multiple different channels.  <br> <br> </p> 
    
            <p> Extending the concept of phase transitions, we can also consider nonequilibrium phase transitions as drastic changes in the dynamical behavior of a system. Indeed, another example of <a class="title" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2218663120" target = "_blank"><b>very recent research</b></a> has used stochastic thermodynamics to study possible early warning signs for drastic changes in a shallow lake ecosystem. <br> <br> </p> 
            
            <p> There is still much, much, much more to do. That's exactly why the rest of this course aims to arm you with all the tools necessary for you to think critically about these urgent problems and advance our understanding of how real dynamical systems evolve! <br> <br> </p>
