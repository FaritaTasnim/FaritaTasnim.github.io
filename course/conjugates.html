        Changes in energy in terms of changes to products of conjugate variables

        </div>
            
            
        <div class="container" style="font-size:11pt;line-height:16px;font-family:'Open Sans'">
            
            <br> <br>
            
            <p> We understand that energy is a fundamental property of any system that exists in this universe. But how does the energy of a system change? What kinds of factors could cause changes in a system's energy? <br> <br> </p> 
            
            <p> From your early physics education, you may remember that forces act on systems in ways that can change their energy. For example, we could apply an upward force to lift a rock and move it up a hill. In doing so, we have created a displacement $\Delta h$ on the rock's height with respect to the ground, and so have increased its potential energy by $\Delta E = mg \Delta h$. <br> <br> </p> 
    
            <p> In thermodynamics we generalize this concept with regards to the change in the average energy of a system. All incremental changes $dE$ to the average energy occur as a result of incremental changes to pairs of generalized forces and generalized displacements $(F, X)$. $$dE = \sum_{ \{ F,X \} } d(FX) $$ These pairs are called conjugate variables because the way they dance with each other determines the ultimate change in the energy. If we think about gases, one example is (pressure, volume). Decreasing pressure goes hand in hand with increasing volume. Increasing pressure goes hand in hand with decreasing volume. The force is the pressure, the displacement is in the volume. If we think about rubber strings, another example is (tension, length). Increasing tension goes hand in hand with increasing length. Decreasing tension goes hand in hand with decreasing length. The force is the tension, the displacement is in the length. <br> <br> </p> 
            
            <p> The generalized force is a property that does not change with the system size. It is called an intensive variable. The generalized displacement is a property that does change with the system size. It is called an extensive variable.  <br> <br> </p> 
        
            <p> Changes to the entropy can cause changes to the energy of the system. Here's a challenge. Let's try to figure out what the conugate variable is for the entropy. <br> <br> </p> 
            
            <p> --- Q --- Firstly, does it make more sense that the entropy is a generalized force (does not change with system size) or a generalized displacement (does change with system size)? Hint: Think about what happens if you combine two systems together. Will the total entropy stay the same or will it increase? <br> <br>
                
                <input type="checkbox" value="A"> generalized force <br> 

                <input type="checkbox" value="B"> generalized displacement * <br> 
                
    
            <p> Right, if we double the size of our system, or combine two systems together, the total entropy (that is, the number of ways the system could exist, or the uncertainty about the system) must increase.  <br> <br> </p> 
            
            <p> --- Q --- Now, what all should be true for the conugate variable for the entropy of a system?<br> <br>
                
                <input type="checkbox" value="A"> Changes in this conjugate variable should result in changes in the number of ways that the system could exist. * <br> 

                <input type="checkbox" value="B"> Changes in this conjugate variable should result in changes to our uncertainty about the state of the system at any point in time. * <br> 
                
                <input type="checkbox" value="C"> This conjugate variable is not a function of the size of the system. * <br> 

                <input type="checkbox" value="D"> This conjugate variable is a function of the size of the system. <br> 
            
            <p> Right, just like changing the tension of a rubber string will change its length, changes to the conjugate variable of entropy must change its entropy, which quantifies the number of ways a system could exist / the amount of uncertainty we have about the state of the system. In particular, this conjugate variable often 'fights' the tendency of the system to settle into the lowest energy state by making accessible the higher energy states.  <br> <br> </p> 
            
            <p> --- Q --- For a physical system such a collection of water molecules, what might be a good candidate for this conjugate variable to entropy? <br> <br>
                
                <input type="checkbox" value="A"> pressure <br> 

                <input type="checkbox" value="B"> volume <br> 
                
                <input type="checkbox" value="C"> gravity <br> 

                <input type="checkbox" value="D"> temperature * <br> 
            
            <p> Right! Viewed another way, the conjugate variable for entropy is that controls the rate of fluctuations in the microstate of the system. We have all learned that increasing the temperature applied to a collection of molecules increases their kinetic energy - this means much more fluctations in the positions of the molecules. More fluctuations means the system could exist in an increasing number of ways, so our uncertainty about the exact specific state of the system increases, and so our entropy increases.  <br> <br> </p> 
    
            <p> Returning to our toy example of Grogu in a box, what would be the conjugate variable for the entropy? Remember that the greater Grogu's irritability, the more frequently he changes his state. And Grogu's irritability is an intensive property - that is, it won't increase if we look at two identical Grogus-in-boxes.And therefore the more uncertain we would become about Grogu's state in that box. So the conjugate variable for the entropy of Grogu in a box is Grogu's irritability.  <br> <br> </p> 
            
            <img src = "irritability.png" style="width:800px;">
            
            <p> Recall our exploration of how Grogu's irritability affects his occupancy of different energy states. Now let's see how that affects his entropy.  <br> <br> </p> 
            
            <p> --- Q --- If Grogu's irritability $I \to 0$, what is his entropy? <br> <br>
                
                <input type="checkbox" value="A"> $\ln 5$ <br> 

                <input type="checkbox" value="B"> $0$ * <br> 
                
                <input type="checkbox" value="C"> $\ln 2$  <br> 

                <input type="checkbox" value="D"> $\infty$ <br> 
                
            <p> --- Q --- If Grogu's irritability $I \to \infty$, what is his entropy? <br> <br>
                
                <input type="checkbox" value="A"> $\ln 5$ * <br> 

                <input type="checkbox" value="B"> $0$ <br> 
                
                <input type="checkbox" value="C"> $\ln 2$  <br> 

                <input type="checkbox" value="D"> $\infty$ <br> <br>
            
            <p> This is exactly how the conjugate variable for entropy should work, as a knob for the entropy itself. We can now use this fact to demistify the coefficient $\beta$ that appears in the probability distribution over Grogu's possible energy states.  <br> <br> </p>
