            <p> Statistical physics relies heavily on our imagination. In particular, as far as we know, only one Grogu in a box exists. However, we can use a mental trick to make a calculation. This mental trick is to imagine that there exists a very very large set (called an ensemble) of systems, each a Grogu-in-a-box. Each such Grogu-in-a-box is randomly chosen from all possible Grogus-in-boxes. We will imagine that this ensemble consists of N systems, and we will consider what happens in the limit that N goes to infinity (the limit that this ensemble consists of a countably infinite number of systems). We can use this ensemble to calculate the probability that Grogu is in a given energy level / macroscopic state. <br> <br> </p> 
            
            <img src = "ensemble.png" style="width:800px;">
            
            <p> Combined with the knowledge that 1) Grogu tries to minimize his energy and 2) there exist 5 different energy levels / macroscopic states Grogu could be in, this mental trick of constructing an ensemble is almost enough to calculate the probability of Grogu being in any one of those macroscopic states if we open the box at a random point in time.  <br> <br> </p> 
    
            <p> As a side note, it's amazing that we can use our ability to imagine different hypothetical "microscopic" scenarios, to assign numbers to them, and to calculate probabilities based on those numbers to make predictions about "macroscopic" variables that actually align with observations in the real world. This fact, that statistical physics works, says something fundamental about the connection between our ability to imagine things in the universe and our ability to perceive and measure things in the universe. This relates deeply to the "many worlds" interpretation of quantum mechanics. <br> <br> </p>
