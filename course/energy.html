        Energy as a fundamental characteristic of a system

        </div>
            
            
        <div class="container" style="font-size:11pt;line-height:16px;font-family:'Open Sans'">
            
            <br> <br>
            
            <p> A 'system' is just an imaginary boundary we draw around a certain collection of items in the universe. These items are also called degrees of freedom, because they can change state (such as their position, velocity of movement, etc.) For any system that we're interested in, we may may use any number of characteristics to describe it. For example, for a collection of $H_2 O$ molecules, some characteristics that come to mind may be its temperature, its volume, its density, its weight, etc. <br> <br> </p> 
    
            <p> What we will come to understand is that the energy of a system is another, and perhaps one of its most fundamental, aspects. For example, for the collection of $H_2 O$ molecules, the energy equals the sum of the potential energy and all forms of kinetic energy (translational movement, rotational movement, vibrational movement, etc.) of each molecule, as well as the energy contained in the interactions between every pair of molecules, every triplet, etc. <br> <br> </p> 
            
            <p> The energy of a system will change based on the precise state of the system. It is therefore, currently, impossible for humans to measure the exact value of the energy of any macroscopic system (or actually of anything larger than systems of a few molecules). For example, the energy level of this collection of $H_2 O$ molecules at some chosen timepoint will depend on the position and velocity of each molecule in the collection at that timepoint. Unfortunately, we don't have the tools to measure the position and velocity of each of the ~$10^{23}$ molecules, because each moves on the temporal scales of less than $10^{-15}$ seconds and spatial scales of less than $10^{-12}$ meters. <br> <br>  </p>  
            
            <p> What is possible for us to do, however, is to use our imagination to compare different energy levels and order them with respect to each other. Even if we don't know the exact value of the energy of each state, we can figure out the ranking of the states with respect to each other in terms of their energy levels. For example, let's say we only have a collection of 2 water molecules. For now let's just pretend that they can only have either a velocity of 1 (arbitrary velocity units). And that their positions can be in one of 4 blocks (2x2 square). Then this system has 2 different energy levels set by the relative positions of the $H_2 O$ molecules. <br> <br>  </p> 
            
            <img src = "water_molecules.png" style="width:800px;">
            
            <p> So we don't know which energy level the system is in right now, because we don't know the current state of the system, but we do know all possible energy values and which states correspond to which energy values. We order the energy levels of the collection of water molecules: $E_1 \le E_2 \le E_3 \le \ldots$ Note that as the number of molecules in our collection grows, the number of different energy levels increases. If there were infinite number of molecules, we'd have what would appear to us a continous spectrum of energies the system could take on. <br> <br>  </p> 
            
            <p> Using this comparison of the different energy levels of the system, even though we can't measure the *exact* value energy of the system, we can do something else that's pretty powerful. We can calculate the probability that the system has a given energy level. Systems at equilibrium tend to minimize their energy.  This is a statement that lower energy states are more likely than higher energy states.  So the probability that a system is in a current state must depend on the energy of the state. Statistical physics is all about this - calculating these probabilities in a systematic way.  Think about how often we try to do this in real life in different contexts when we don't know the exact value of something (although usually we do this in an intuitive, much less systematic way).  For example, we don't know another person's opinion about something unless we ask them (and even then we can't be 100% sure they are telling the truth), so we assign probabilities - based on my judgement of my friend's personality, I think the probability they will like receiving a flower as a gift is 90%. Or, we never know the exact weather until it happens, so we're told there's a 43% chance it will rain in the next hour. Using statistical physics, we can calculate the probability that collection of the water molecules has a given energy value, $P(E_j)$. This might be useful to us if we want to harvest some amount of energy from that water, for example. <br> <br>  </p> 
            
            <p> Importantly, the probability that the system is at any given energy level will depend on the values of the other characteristics of the system. For example, if we know that our friend recently had an asthma attack after inhaling the pollen of a foreign flower, we know the probability that our friend will like to receive a flower as a gift will be drastically lower.  For the weather, if we know a cold front and hot front are about to collide in our area in the next hour, the probability of rain will increase. Similarly, based on the other macroscopic characteristics of the system, we can determine how the probability distribution of different states/energies adjust.  <br> <br>  </p> 
            
            <p> --- Q --- Similarly, if we increase the temperature of a collection of molecules, how do you think the probability that the system is at a given energy level changes? <br> <br>
                
                <input type="checkbox" value="A"> the probability that the system occupies lower energy levels increases and the probability that the system occupies higher energy levels increases <br>

                <input type="checkbox" value="B"> the probability that the system occupies lower energy levels decreases and the probability that the system occupies higher energy levels increases * <br>

                <input type="checkbox" value="C"> the probability that the system occupies lower energy levels increases and the probability that the system occupies higher energy levels decreases <br>

                <input type="checkbox" value="D"> the probability that the system occupies lower energy levels decreases and the probability that the system occupies higher energy levels decreases <br> <br>  </p> 
            
            <p> Right, temperature increases the kinetic energy of molecules, so there should be higher probability that the system is occupying a higher energy state. Because the total probability of all outcomes must equal 1, that means the probability that the system occupies a lower energy state must decrease. <br> <br>  </p> 
            
            <p> So, let's now use the principles of statistical physics to calculate the probability that a system is in a given state. To do this, we're going to consider a system that consists of a large collection of molecules in a closed box. But to make it more fun we're going to consider the case where that collection of molecules is a creature named Grogu. Meet Grogu. <br> <br>  </p> 
            
            <img src = "meet_grogu.png" style="width:400px;">
            
            <p> The interesting part is that all of the principles of statistical physics can apply if Grogu's behavior in the system meets a couple of assumptions. Let's explore those assumptions now.  <br> <br>  </p>
