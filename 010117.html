<h3> Whirlwinds </h3>
<p class="indented"> 
   Gasping for air, I’ve plunged out of the worst dream of my life, one that has consumed me for the past 19 years. This dream, I molded from clay with my hands. This dream, I breathed into it life. This dream, I kept alive if it was ever on the edge of death. For 19 years.  </p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   Enough.</p>

<p class="indented"> 
   Kya baal.</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   Now I’m underground, sinking, desperately grasping for the roots of the majestic peace tree, always falling short. But I have to keep trying.</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   It’s dangerous when you mix an obsessive personality with an egotistical mindset. Add a cup of stubbornness and a spoonful of poorly fulfilled perfectionism and you get something toxic. Inside me there developed a toxic ego who is selfish beyond measure and, worse, who cannot let things go. Who is constantly bounding and leaping into a state of misery, victimizing myself to make others feel worse. And, most ironic and gross of all, I thus became pitifully dependent on others and nastily hurtful towards those that gave me the most love, care, and happiness. Let’s not victimize myself though. I admit that this deathly concoction is certainly completely the result of my own doings. I have accepted defeat against my worst enemy - myself.</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   The past couple of months especially, I have been living a nightmare that my mind conjured up to mask my insecurities and to shelter my ego, which was pained and sensitive. Another ghastly combination.</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   Every day, I ached.</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   Every day, I cried.</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   Every day, things got worse.</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   And, I was making a mountain out of things which are, to a person at peace, molehills. It is true, however, that it was not all bad. I was not always hurtfully selfish, but most of the time I was. The situation manifested itself as a general aura of intentionally developed, yet unintentionally bad, habits consuming most of my actions, punctuated by some productive thoughts, some realizations that brought about peace… But I never pieced the reality of the situation all together.</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   I was afraid - and frankly still am, deeply afraid of being left out, of missing out, of not being wanted, of becoming that cowardly lone wolf who longed for the pack. In trying to deal with these fears, I have only further deepened the wounds I wear… my insecurities. When I became sad, it was a rather peculiar matter. At even the slightest touch, I would experience a seemingly uncontrollable rush of sadness. The kind of sadness that feels as if a giant dam has broken behind my eyes, and a huge force of water has inundated me such that my only gasps of air come from drowning myself further in my pain and suffering. Once you’ve accustomed yourself to taking literally everything personally, wanting everything to go your way, and, on top of that, feeling that you’re justified in doing so, life becomes difficult, almost unbearable. </p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   In the end, I was saved. What luck. I am so grateful for one of the most important people in my life. I am able to trust him to help me become a better person. This is a really big deal, since it’s awfully difficult for others to try to understand and help someone in pain. But his reaction was the remedy I wish I could have mustered from within myself, had I enough courage. I needed to be told how I was being unreasonable, hypocritical, uncaring, shallow, and selfish in a horrid way. I am so grateful he told me these things, effectively knocking me out of my blinding stupor. I am grateful that another one of the most beautiful and admirable people in my life told me these same things. </p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   What a fantasy I have been living for 19 years!</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   From much-needed recent personal introspection as well as reading from https://zenhabits.net/, I have realized that the mind doesn’t enjoy being hurt, and to prevent itself from hurting, the mind invents stories that project fault on other people and other things. These stories are massively powerful. Armed with this potent storytelling ability, you gain a false sense of security that ultimately hacks away at your mental stability, which unfortunately in my case was already as fragile as untempered glass. If you tell yourself one story to feel better, it’s probably okay. Ten stories, still probably okay. You start telling yourself stories at every last moment, every single interaction, every darned thought, and then… Unfortunately now the poor Homo sapiens brain cannot handle the processing power needed to seamlessly incorporate every freshly concocted story into this newly synthesized world you’ve created in your head.</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   Confusion ensues.</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   But you still want to believe you’re right! And then…</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   BAM! Someone tells you your true faults - why you’re wrong. A massive meteor blows your heavenly world, which by now was already bursting at the seams, into bits and pieces, and all that’s left is emptiness, a feeling of loss, much like a newborn baby. Regrettably, by now, the tendency when you have a clean slate at an old age is to fall again into the bad habits, harmful imagination, and world creation. But the objective should be to fight. Actively. Every single day. And change actions, so as to start afresh, and truly afresh - without glancing at the past. Start afresh. Like a newborn baby.</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   I’m always longing for a feeling of comfort, but until now I have not realized that it cannot always be provided from external sources… I have no control of what others do, and thus I should not feel particularly, let alone acutely, affected negatively as a result, especially knowing that negative feelings tend to build up and immobilize me. </p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   So what can I control?</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   I can control myself. I can control my feelings, and my thoughts, which arise from my feelings, and my actions, which arise from both my thoughts and my feelings. I can effectively be most comfortable when I am most at peace with myself and completely in control of myself. Thus, I am grateful that I am now healing, and trying quite diligently to correct myself, for my own betterment. Of course, I’m still not perfect, and those bad habits sometimes come creeping back. When I lose the fight against my own demons, I’m upset with myself and with how I have treated those victim to my demons, and that’s why I keep fighting.</p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   For a fragile mind like mine, the comforts of sacrificing others’ egos for the happiness of mine is enticing, but I know that’s wrong. That’s why I keep fighting. </p>
    
<p class="indented"> 
   Though I am late in realizing it, I must nurture my mind and my ego, until they are well-trained and prepared to handle gracefully this world with all its pain, misery, and suffering. Thus, I go forth with hopes of mindfulness and peace, hand in hand with my worst enemy, myself.</p>
